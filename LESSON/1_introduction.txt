Introduction to Python :
-----------------------

-> Introduction to Python
    - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language
    - Known for its simplicity and readability
    - Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991
    - Used in web development, data science, AI, automation, etc.

    Important information about python:
        - Python is case-sensitive
        - Indentation defines code blocks

-> Basic Programming Concepts
    - Programs are sets of instructions for computers
    - Code is executed line by line
    - Comments use # for single line or ''' for multiple lines

-> Variables and Data Types
    #Variables: 
        - Variables are containers for storing data
        - Created by assigning a value: x = 5
        - Names must start with letter/underscore
        - Case sensitive

    #Data Types
        1. Numbers
            - Integer (int): 5, -17, 1000
            - Float (float): 3.14, -0.001, 2.0

        2. Strings (str)
            - Text data: "Hello", 'Python'
            - Created with single or double quotes

        3. Boolean (bool)
            - True or False values
            - Used for logical operations

-> Conditional Statements
    if-elif-else
        if condition:
            # code block
        elif another_condition:
            # code block
        else:
            # code block

        Example:
        age = 18
        if age >= 18:
            print("Adult")
        else:
            print("Minor")

-> Loops
    # For Loop
        - Used for iterating over a sequence
        for item in sequence:
            #code block

        Example:
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)

    # While Loop
        - Repeats while condition is True
        while condition:
            # code block

        Example:
        count = 0
        while count < 5:
            print(count)
            count += 1
